        <h3>A little about me</h3>
        <p>My name is Fatimah Khan and I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA I am one of three kids being the middle child. I have an older brother and a younger sister and have about a 2-year age gap between the two of them. I am very clumsy and I like to think of myself as silly and goofy. I am a first-generation American with my family coming from Pakistan. I am a first-year student at Penn State Behrend and am hoping to become a Civil Engineer and am planning to transfer to University Park. I want to eventually go to grad school and get my masters in Civil Engineering. Some small things about me are that I like the color navy blue, I am trying to start a small business, my favorite season is Fall, and I want to travel the world. Some things I really enjoy doing are henna, drawing, playing games, being with friends, and watching movies.</p>
