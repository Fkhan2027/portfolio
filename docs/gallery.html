        <p>Below are some digital assignments that I've worked on in the past few years.</p>
        <br></br>
        <h1>High School</h1>
        <p>DDuring my senior year of high school a friend and I took a class called Engineer Design and Development (EDD). In EDD the first step in engineering a solution to a problem was to find a problem. We spent a few days asking ourselves "Don't you hate it when?" and created a list. From that list, we narrowed it down from 50 ideas to 25 to 5 to 3 then 1 and finally choosing the best between the two. The topic we chose to do was about umbrellas because many injuries happen with beach and patio umbrellas yearly and at least one person gets impaled a year. We then went on to research different things like what's on the market, patents, statistics, and many more. At the end of the year, we ended up with a fully functional prototype and presented our findings to teachers and engineers.</p>

        <h1>Digit 100</h1>
        <p>During my first semester here at Behrend there are lots of digital assignments that I've worked on in Digit 100. One of those assignments includes making a website work with GitHub and also creating this website on WordPress. </p>
        <p>Another digital assignment that we have done in Digit 100 is working with Hypothesis. Hypothesis is a computer extension that lets the user annotate a webpage in a group or for the whole world to see. We used this mainly at the beginning of the semester as for a lot of assignments we were given a website and told to annotate it using the extension in the class group.</p>
        <p>Along with this we also created Twine games. We were asked to read a story called Leaf by Niggle and annotated it as we went. We then used Twine to create a game based on the story and each student created a game and created their own little twist to the story.</p>
