       <h1>GitHub</h1>
        The most challenging part for a new learner using GitHub is learning how to code HTML and then pushing it to GitHub. Coming from not knowing how to code it was challenging and because it was challenging for me at times, I became a little unmotivated to do it because at times I didn't know what to do. Then using Git bash was also challenging because there are a lot of things you need to do to get your website published and it was confusing for a new learner. The advantage of GitHub compared to WordPress is that since you’re making your website from scratch you get to make everything how you want it to be, and the possibilities are endless. The challenges for editing the website layout were that sometimes I couldn’t understand what I was doing wrong in my code and alternating to a simpler solution compared to the original vision to get what I wanted to achieve. With editing the layout there is a lot of trial and error and a lot of going back and forth between Oxygen and my web page and searching up how to fix it. The main skill that you need is to understand how code works and be able to apply it to whatever you are trying to create. The skills that I need to work on for my GitHub website are trying to format things better and making my website more appealing to the eye.
       <h1>WordPress</h1>
        <p>Nothing in WordPress was too difficult, some things were just hidden, and it could be a little tedious at times. The most difficult part for me was just navigating the site and learning how to use it. WordPress has an advantage over GitHub because a lot of the things you need to edit it are right there and you don’t need to do a lot of CSS or coding to get your website as you want it to be. You can do a little bit of coding on WordPress, but it isn’t necessary. The main challenge of getting the layout on WordPress is finding the right layout that you want from what WordPress gives you. It’s a lot of playing around and finding the one that suits you and your website. There isn’t much skill you need to work with WordPress, you only need to learn your way around. There isn’t much to improve on in WordPress except for making it more aesthetically pleasing. </p>
